# Case Study: TransferWise

## **Overview**

TransferWise is a London-based FinTech startup that offers borderless financial transfer services across 50 different currencies. It was established in 2011 by the Estonian former Skype employees, Kristo K채채rmann and Taavet Hinrikus. Both of them were working in London when the idea of forming the company came up.



Every month they had to send money back to Estonia to pay bills and mortgage. But the transfer fee was unreasonably high and the processing time was too long. K채채rmann and Hinrikus believed that there must be somehow a better and cheaper way to wire money overseas; they decided to invent TransferWise as a new platform for online money transfer service that allows customers to send money at a low rate with no hidden-fee and much faster than the banks. 

According to Crunchbase, TransferWise is funded by investors and has raised over $772 million in 10 rounds of venture funding. During its last round of funding in 2019, the company raised $292 million with the final estimate of $3.5 billion.

## **Technologies Used**

The company's mission is to create a better way to send money without borders, with low fees, fast, fair rates, and eventually for free. In Q2 and Q3 of this year, the company has been focusing mainly on the improvement of remittance speed and minimizing the fee.

According to the business canvas developed by Alex Osterwalder et al, ex-pats, freelancers, everyday consumers, and businesses. The company has more than 6 million customers around the world. Expats and freelancers are the major segments that may use either international money transfer service or borderless digital banking. More than 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses opening an account each month.

### *Integrating with central banks* 
The company worked directly with local banks in particular countries such as Hungary, to accelerate the transaction process. According to the Q3 report, the payment speed has improved from 28% in Q2 to 32% in present. As a result of this development, the payment processing time is almost instant or within an hour for Hungary. 

The process also helped in removing the middleman between TransferWise and the bank. In other words, the company can gain more profit but choose to pass that back to the users by reducing the transfer fee instead.

TransferWise is categorized in Personal Finance and Online Banking section, in which the technologies have been evolving during this past decade. It caused an impact on the banking industry excessively. The eruption of these innovations like Digital Account Opening (DAO), Payment Remittance, Video Marketing, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), etc., have changed the finance world and consumer behaviors completely.

## **Strengths and Weaknesses**


The companies in this section are more flexible and have a strong focus on customer experience. They simplify financial transaction processes by providing online services with low fees and time-efficient through mobile or web applications. To illustrate, TransferWise also offers a digital-only and borderless bank account besides having international money transfer; the account allows the user to hold over 50 currencies at once and exchange anytime. Moreover, the customers can also request for TransferWise debit Mastercard with no charge, which can be used worldwide at the real exchange rates. Other leading companies in this platform are WorldRemit, PayPal, Western Union, MoneyGram, Azimo, CurrencyFair, etc.

Payment processing time, transfer fee, service location is what TransferWise has been trying to improve overtime. Also, to evaluate business success of the compananies in this domain, they are likely to count on the number of new accounts, positive consumer reviews, revenue growth, and the value of stocks. 

To illustrate, the TransferWise annual revenue and profits report shows the company is profitable and its revenue continues to grow rapidly since 2018. Moreover, Transferwise is rated 4.7/5 on Trustpilot by 100,537 users, with 86% voted for excellent service, which is more than WorldRemit, one of its competitors.

## **Recommendations**

TransferWise should invest in a *mobile wallet service* for international money transfer since the company only supports bank-to-bank transfers, which is quite limited and time-consuming. This could become its weakness compared to the competitor like WorldRemit, whose already have this technology as part of their money transfer service.  

 If TransferWise has a mobile wallet services,the users will be able to send money directly to the mobile phones of the recipient overseas. The recipient will receive and can spend money right away. Not only the company is able to extend its market segments but also overcomes the current issue with the payment speed. This would help the company increase revenue and become more competitive in the long run.
