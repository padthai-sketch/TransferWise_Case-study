#  Transferwise
## Overview
### TransferWise is a London-based FinTech startup that offers borderless financial transfer services across 50 different currencies. It was established in 2011 by the Estonian former Skype employees, Kristo K채채rmann and Taavet Hinrikus. Both of them were working in London when the idea of forming the company came up. 

Every month they had to send money back to Estonia to pay bills and mortgage. But the transfer fee was unreasonably high and the processing time was too long. K채채rmann and Hinrikus believed that there must be somehow a better and cheaper way to wire money overseas; they decided to invent TransferWise as a new platform for online money transfer service that allows customers to send money at a low rate with no hidden-fee and much faster than the banks. 

According to Crunchbase, TransferWise is funded by investors and has raised over $772 million in 10 rounds of venture funding. During its last round of funding in 2019, the company raised $292 million with the final estimate of $3.5 billion.
